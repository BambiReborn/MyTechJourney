            <h3><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Hey guys!</span> 
                <br>I'm Chukwuemeka Udeh...</h3>
            
            <p>
                Ok, this website is a brief but interesting story about I and my tech journey.
                <br>Sit tight! pay attention, while I sip my coffee and begin.😊
                <br>
                <br>
                Tech didn’t just catch my interest, it pulled me in. 
                What started as simple curiosity quickly turned into a passion. 
                The first time I saw a line of code actually do something, I was hooked. 
                I realized the digital world isn’t just something we use, 
                it’s something we can control, build, and bend to our will. That power? Yeah, it’s addictive.
            </p>
            <p>
                I fell in love with the logic, the freedom, and the creativity tech gives me. 
                The fact that I can sit in my room, type some commands, and make a whole system work exactly how I want, 
                that’s the kind of magic that never gets old. Whether it’s web development or automation, 
                I get a kick out of making things move without even touching them. 
                It’s like I speak the computer’s language, and it listens.😁
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the thrill of creating, I’ve also tapped into the soft side of tech: 
                the ability to earn from anywhere, on my own time, without burning out. 
                No heavy lifting, no stress, just vibes, WiFi, and skill. I like my work to feel smooth, like I’m in control. 
                A few times I've had a little arguements with my mom, about how the world has gone digital and alot
                of people make millions without sweating, and even while they're at sleep, all from the comfort of their home. 
                I went ahead to learn graphinc design, which was interesting and felt so good when I designed my first every public flyer.
                That’s what drew me to tech and keeps me locked in. Every new thing I learn? 
                That’s one step closer to full digital freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now it’s bigger than just learning, it’s a lifestyle. In the course of seeking grounded knowledge, I learned about 
                <a href="https://genesystechhub.com">GenesysTechHub</a> from my brother's friend, who was an intern of the 
                <a href="https://Learnable.GenesysTechHub.com">Learnable</a>... I think 2020, can't really remember, but yea,
                that's how I found my way to the UpSkill, after so much inquiries and since the induction, 
                it has been an exciting experience.
